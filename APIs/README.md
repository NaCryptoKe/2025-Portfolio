# Comprehensive API Development Roadmap  

### **Goal**  
Build RESTful APIs with databases, authentication, and deployment strategies.

### **May: Deployment & Documentation**  
**Focus:** Deploy APIs to production and document endpoints for easy usage.  

#### Key Topics:  
- Environment variables (`.env`)  
- API documentation best practices  

#### Projects:  
1. **Deploy to Heroku/Render (Day 1-3)**  
   - Host your Blog Post API on a cloud platform.  

2. **API Docs with Swagger (Day 4-6)**  
   - Document your Todo API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI.  

#### Resources:  
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io)

### **June: Advanced APIs & Integrations**  
**Focus:** Build advanced APIs with third-party integrations and webhooks.  

#### Key Topics:  
- Slack/Discord webhooks  
- Payment gateways (e.g., Stripe test mode)  

#### Projects:  
1. **Slack Notification API (Day 1-5)**  
   - Send messages to Slack when specific events occur.  

2. **Mock Payment API (Day 6-9)**

## **Julyâ€“January: Full-Stack Integration**  
Focus on combining JavaScript and APIs into full-stack projects such as:  
- **Blog Platform**  
- **E-commerce Site**  
- **Portfolio Deployment**  

Let me know if you'd like more details for later months! ðŸ”¥
