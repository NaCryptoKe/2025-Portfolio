# 2025 Portfolio üöÄ

Welcome to my **2025 Portfolio**, where I document my learning journey in **C++**, **JavaScript**, and **API Development**. This repository is structured to showcase my progress, projects, and goals as I master these technologies through a year-long plan.

---

## Goals for 2025

- **Master C++**: Explore advanced concepts like STL, multithreading, memory management, and game engine development.
- **Deepen JavaScript Skills**: Build interactive web apps, master React, and develop full-stack applications.
- **API Development Expertise**: Learn to design, secure, and deploy scalable RESTful APIs integrated with databases and third-party services.

## Folder Structure üìÇ

### APIs

A collection of projects to build, secure, and deploy **RESTful APIs**:
- **Basics**: Understand HTTP methods, Express routing, and JSON responses.
- **Databases**: CRUD operations using MongoDB and Mongoose.
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication with secure password hashing.
- **Deployment**: Host APIs on platforms like Heroku or Render.
- **Advanced APIs**: Integrate with third-party APIs and webhooks.

#### Sample Projects
- **Joke API**: Fetch, add, and update jokes.
- **Blog Post API**: Full CRUD with MongoDB.
- **Slack Notification API**: Send automated messages to Slack channels.

### C++

A journey into **Comprehensive C++ Development**, featuring structured modules for mastering the language:
- **Foundations**: Syntax, data structures, and OOP.
- **Game Development**: Build 2D/3D games using SDL and OpenGL.
- **Advanced Topics**: Multithreading, concurrency, and optimization.

#### Sample Projects

### JavaScript

A **Comprehensive JavaScript Roadmap**, focusing on building interactive web applications and mastering modern libraries:
- **Basics**: DOM manipulation, event handling, and vanilla JavaScript projects.
- **APIs**: Work with fetch, JSON parsing, and async/await.
- **React**: Create reusable components, manage state, and implement hooks.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Combine JavaScript with backend APIs.

#### Sample Projects
- **To-Do App**: DOM manipulation and local storage integration.
- **Weather App**: Fetch and display data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **React Recipe Finder**: A responsive React app that fetches recipe data using an API.
