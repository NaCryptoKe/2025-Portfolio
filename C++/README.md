# Comprehensive C++ Learning Roadmap  

**Goal**: Build a strong foundation in C++ while progressively creating projects to reinforce and expand your understanding of key concepts.

## February: C++ Basics & Fundamentals  
**Focus**: Master the basics of syntax, control flow, functions, and file I/O.  

### Key Topics:  
- Variables and data types  
- Arithmetic and conditional operators  
- Control structures: loops (for, while)  
- Functions: parameters and return types  
- Arrays and basic file I/O (`fstream`)  
- Debugging basics (using IDE tools and `cout` debugging)  

### Weekly Breakdown:  
#### Week 1: Variables, Operators, and Control Structures  
**Goal**: Master syntax, arithmetic, and conditional logic.  
**Daily Projects**:  
- **Day 1**: Unit Converter (e.g., miles ↔ kilometers)  
  - Use `cin`, `cout`, variables, and arithmetic operators.  
  - Example: Convert user-input miles to kilometers.  

- **Day 2**: Number Guesser  
  - Generate a random number (1-10) with `rand()`.  
  - Use `if/else` to check guesses.  

- **Day 3**: Simple Calculator  
  - Implement add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  
  - Use `switch` statements for operator selection.  

- **Day 4**: Multiplication Table Generator  
  - Use `for` loops to print tables (e.g., 5×1 to 5×10).  

- **Day 5**: Sum of Numbers Calculator  
  - Use a `while` loop to sum numbers until the user enters 0.  

- **Day 6**: Prime Number Checker  
  - Use loops and conditionals to determine if a number is prime.

#### Week 2: Functions and Arrays  
**Goal**: Learn modular code and array manipulation.  
**Daily Projects**:  
- **Day 7**: Function-Based Validation  
  - Write a `bool isValidNumber(string input)` function to validate input.  

- **Day 8**: Array Reversal  
  - Reverse the order of elements in a fixed-size array.  

- **Day 9**: Average Score Calculator  
  - Use an array to store 5 grades, compute the average with a function.  

- **Day 10**: Password Strength Checker  
  - Write a function to check password length and character diversity.  

---

#### Week 3: File I/O Basics  
**Goal**: Read/write files and process data.  
**Daily Projects**:  
- **Day 11**: Write to a File  
  - Use `ofstream` to save user input to a `.txt` file.  

- **Day 12**: Read from a File  
  - Use `ifstream` to read and print a text file line-by-line.  

- **Day 13**: File Appender  
  - Use `ofstream` in append mode to add text to an existing file.  

- **Day 14**: Word Counter  
  - Count words in a single line of text by splitting a string using spaces.  

---

#### Week 4: Final Projects  
**Goal**: Combine all concepts into two portfolio projects.  
**Daily Projects**:  
- **Day 15-16**: Temperature Converter  
  - Build Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit conversions and add error handling for invalid inputs.  

- **Day 17-19**: Text File Analyzer  
  - Count lines, words, and characters in a file with error handling for missing files.  

- **Day 20**: Add a Menu System  
  - Create a loop-based menu system for easy navigation.

---

### Stretch Goals (Optional):  
- **Day 21**: Password Generator + Saver  
  - Generate random passwords and save them to a file.  

- **Day 22**: Student Data Entry System  
  - Store names and grades in a file for record-keeping.
