Day 3: February, 11 2025. Time Taken: 40 minutes

Loops/iteration is happens if the condition given was true and won't do that if it was false.
An infinite loop is when the condition is always true
1. While loop
while (condition)
{// statement goes here.}
2. do while loop is a while loop but first it executes some statement. It atleast gets executed at least once unlike while loop which might not get even executed once
do
{
    // statement
}while (condition); // semicolon is needed at the end
3. for loop: is a kind of loop almost the same as a while loop, but mostly used for a known amount, for iterating and even use the letter i for iterrating
for (int i = 0; i <= value; i++// it can be increasing or decreasing)
{ //statement}
4. Nested Loops: are loops within another loop

Jump statements or loop control statements: they are used to alter the normal flow of a loop
1. Break: is used to break out of a loop, or a swith as seen in the previous examples for switches
2. Continue: skips the current iteration
3. Goto: Jumps a labeled statement within the same function
usage is as follows
Example: goto flower; 
statements;
flower;
// this block of code will jump over statements; to flower
4. Return: Exits from a function and optionally returns a value

Random numbers: you need to use rand(). They are not truly random (but close) which are called pseudo-random
int num = rand(); // will give you between 0 and 32,767 which is the RAND_MAX

Functions: are a block of reusable code.
[return Type] [function Name]({parameters if necessary})
{//functionality goes here
return something;//if the return Type isn't void}
void simply means it doesn't have a return type
