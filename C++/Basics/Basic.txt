Learned C++ from bro code: https://youtu.be/-TkoO8Z07hI?si=dTz7AM-FAABazGzy

Why you need to learn c++?
C++ is fast, commonly used in advanced graphics application. Examples are adobe application, video editing softwares.
Commonly used with embeded systems, and creating video games.
C++ is a middle level language.

Things needed to start.
1. Text editors. VScode and the like are IDE(Integrated Development Environment), they contain a lot developer tools.
2. Compiler is a piece of software that basically turn source code (the code we have written) to machine instructions (to binary)

The extension for c++ is .cpp or .c++

A comment in C++ can be written using // or /**/. It is used for helping the developer or other developer understand what is happenning in the code.
// - is called an inline comment. And /**/ is called a multiline comment.

Variables
Variables are a particular name given to a certain value.
There are two in creating and using a value, the first is declaration and the second is assignment.
Declaration: [Data Type] [Variable Name]; Example: int x;
Assignment: [Variable Name] = [Values]; Example: x = 4;

We can print the output using std::cout<<x; std means the standard library, and cout means character output.

There are different type of data types in C++:
int or integer stores a whole number which basically means all numbers that don't have a floating decimal value. If the number has a decimal point C++ will remove the decimal value and just give you the floor value instead.
Example: int x = 5;
double are like integer but they can store floating points unlike integers.
Example: double x = 5.5;
char datatype stores a single character. It is assigned using the single quotation.
Example: char x = 'A';
boolean or bool is a datatype that only holds a true or false value. Think of like using a light switch, it can only be on or off.
Example: bool x = true;
This four data type are called primitive data types.

strings can be regarded as a variable but it is actually an object made up of a sequence of characters.

The const keyword makes a variable not changable meaning basically they are only readonly. The formal naming convention for const variables are all capital letters.

A namespace: provides a solution for preventing name coflicts in large projects. Each entity needs a unique name. A namespace allows for identically named entities as long as the namespaces are different.
namespace [Namespace name] {}
The :: is known as the scope resolution operators.
