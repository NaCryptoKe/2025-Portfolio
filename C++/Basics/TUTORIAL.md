## ❓ **Why Learn C++?** 🖥️
✅ **Fast & Powerful** ⚡
✅ **Used in Graphics & Video Editing** 🎨🎬
✅ **Embedded Systems & Game Development** 🎮
✅ **Middle-Level Language** 🏗️

---

## 🛠️ **Things Needed to Start**
1️⃣ **Text Editors** 📝 *(e.g., VS Code, IDEs)*
2️⃣ **Compiler** 🏭 *(Converts source code to machine code)*

📂 **File Extension**: `.cpp` or `.c++`

---

## 💬 **Comments in C++** ✍️
```cpp
// This is an inline comment
/* This is a 
   multiline comment */
```

---

## 🎭 **Variables in C++** 🔢
### 🔹 **Declaration & Assignment**
```cpp
int x;  // Declaration
x = 4;  // Assignment
```

### 🖨️ **Printing Output**
```cpp
std::cout << x;  // std = standard library, cout = character output
```

---

## 📊 **Data Types in C++**
- **`int`** ➡️ Stores whole numbers 📏
  ```cpp
  int x = 5;
  ```
- **`double`** ➡️ Stores floating-point numbers 🌊
  ```cpp
  double x = 5.5;
  ```
- **`char`** ➡️ Stores a single character 🔤
  ```cpp
  char x = 'A';
  ```
- **`bool`** ➡️ Stores `true` or `false` values 🎚️
  ```cpp
  bool x = true;
  ```

🔹 *These four are called primitive data types!* 🎯

---

## 📜 **Strings in C++** 🔡
🔸 Strings are objects made up of a sequence of characters.

---

## 🔐 **Constant Variables (`const`)**
🛑 **Immutable values** (Read-Only)
```cpp
const int X = 10;  // Naming convention: ALL CAPS
```

---

## 🏷️ **Namespaces in C++** 🌍
👨‍💻 *Prevents naming conflicts in large projects!*
```cpp
namespace MyNamespace {
    int x = 10;
}
```

🎯 `::` is the **Scope Resolution Operator**

🎉 **That's it for today!** Keep coding and have fun! 🚀🔥
